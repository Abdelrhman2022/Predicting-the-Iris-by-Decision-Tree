# Predicting the Iris by Decision Tree

Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly. 

# Dataset 
- Dataset can be found here https://bit.ly/3kXTdox 

- Also can import it using
```  sklearn.datasets ``` 

# Hperparameter Tuning

```
{'max_depth': 20, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 15}
 ```
